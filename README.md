### Description
This team profile generator allows the user to build a dashboard for their team.

### Usage
There are currently 3 roles that exist: manager, engineer, and intern. The user must provide each employee's name, id number, and email address in the prompts. Depending on the employee roles, additional questions may vary.

After the first employee is added, a file called "index_generated.html" will be created and contain all the information. As the user continues to add new employees, the template will continue to update with the information provided.
